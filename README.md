# Daily-Planner-App

Here I created a daily planner app that shows the current date, the hours of a typical business day, and allows you to enter text on each hour of the day to plan out activities hour by
hour. This app also shows different colors for the "past" "present" and "future" hours, with the corresponding colors of grey, red, and green.

I was unable to get the information in text area field to save to localstorage, and pull that local storage value on reload.
